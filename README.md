### Watch your website accessibility compliance with Level CI

Level CI helps developers maintain high WCAG and ADA compliance in their web applications through automated analysis of pull requests and branches. Level CI detects accessibility violations and provides clear remediation guidance to help fix issues.

**Fine-grained feedback, early in development cycle** - analyze your web applications automatically after every commit and get a comprehensive report in your pull request directly.

**Web accessibility monitoring** - track accessibility metrics across your projects: WCAG compliance without manual oversight.

**Integration with CI/CD** - fail pipelines and block deployments when accessibility standards are not met. It natively integrates with GitHub, Bitbucket, and other VCS platforms, providing detailed feedback on accessibility violations directly in pull requests.

**Developer-focused experience** - learn and implement accessibility best practices with a tool that fits precisely into developers' workflows.

**Requirements:**

- Create your account on [Level CI](https://cicd.userway.org)
- Import your web application repository to analyze in just a few clicks
- Integrate Level CI accessibility reports generation into your end-to-end tests. Cypress, Playwright, Selenium and Puppeteer are supported. Read more about [e2e tests integrations](https://docs.cicd.userway.org/)

**Usage:**

Project metadata, including the location of the reports to be analyzed, must be declared in the file level-ci.config.js (or level-ci.config.ts) in the base directory

    // level-ci.config.js
    /** @type {import('@userway/cicd-cli').Config} */
    module.exports = {
      organization: 'my-organization-slug',
      project: 'my-project-name',
      token: process.env.LEVEL_CI_TOKEN,
      reportPaths: ['./uw-a11y-reports']
    };

The workflow, usually declared in .github/workflows/build.yml, looks like:

    # .github/workflows/build.yml
    - name: Level CI Accessibility Analysis
      uses: UserWayOrg/cicd-action@main
      env:
        LEVEL_CI_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.LEVEL_CI_TOKEN }}

**Secrets:**

_LEVEL_CI_TOKEN_ â€“ this is the token used to authenticate access to Level CI. You can get a token on your project settings page, then set the LEVEL_CI_TOKEN environment variable in the "Secrets" settings page of your repository.
